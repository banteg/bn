# Exact callsite recovery

Prefer `bn callsites` over ad hoc `py exec` when the task is "find exact native RNG return-address callers" or any similar direct-call mapping workflow.

`bn callsites` reports both:
- `call_addr`: the native `call ...` instruction address
- `caller_static`: the exact post-call return address

The key rule is:
- `caller_static = call_addr + instruction_length`

Use it like this:

```bash
bn callsites crt_rand --within bonus_pick_random_type --caller-static
bn callsites crt_rand --within fx_queue_add_random --caller-static
bn callsites crt_rand --within-file /tmp/rng-functions.txt --format json
bn callsites crt_rand --format ndjson
```

Omit the scope when you want Binary Ninja's inbound reference index to derive all caller functions. Add `--within` or `--within-file` when you already know the relevant callers and want the fastest narrow result.

The `--within-file` format is one function identifier per non-empty line. Lines beginning with `#` are ignored.

For close-together callsites, `bn callsites` also returns:
- previous instructions
- next instructions
- `call_index` within the containing function
- `within_query` with the original unresolved scope token
- a local-or-null HLIL statement
- a best-effort `pre_branch_condition`

`hlil_statement` is intentionally local-or-null. If Binary Ninja only exposes a coarse enclosing region instead of the smallest call-containing expression or statement, expect `hlil_statement: null` rather than a noisy whole-function blob.

`pre_branch_condition` means the nearest enclosing pre-call HLIL condition when it can be recovered confidently. It is not a generic "related branch" field, so `null` is normal when the condition cannot be derived cleanly.

Use `bn xrefs` when you only need inbound references. Use `bn callsites` when you need exact return-address recovery and local context around the call.
